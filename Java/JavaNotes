OOP 

Java OOP Concepts

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Java is platform independent and can be executed on any OS because it is Java is compiled and interpreted which is what makes it popular

Java code is compiled and produces Java byte code

Java source (.java) --> Java Compiler --> Java bytecode (.class)

This byte code is then passed to the interpreter to run based on the system 

the main method is the entry point of your java code 

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}

Java is object oriented because you have to create objects in order to call the operations defined within a class (using the new keyword)

Major Concepts of OOP: 

- Abstraction
* abstraction is the process of hiding certain details 

- Inheritance
* a mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class
* using key word extends will allow child class **code reusability** 

- Encapsulation

- Polymorphism
* ability of an object tot take on many forms. ie when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object
* any java object that can pass more than one is-a test is considered to be polymorphic
in java all objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the is-a test for their own type and the class Object
* the only way to access an object is through a reference variable. a reference variable can be of only one type
* performing a single operation in different ways

* Overloading
multiple functions with the same name, but different signature (ie number of parameters, type of parameters, etc) 
related to compile-time (static) polymorphism

* Overriding
- override the functionality of an existing method
